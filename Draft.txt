update "Happens Before"

Why wait(), notify() and notifyAll() are in Object Class ?

************************************************************************************************************************************
Sometimes type casts are unavoidable and in Generic code they happen often without the programmer ever noticing. Therefore, significant effort was made to make type cast quite fast.

Telescoping constructor pattern: One constructor with only required fields and many other construtors with different combinations of optional fields. Difficult to mantain and bug prone.

JavaBeans Pattern: One constructor with only required fields and setters for all other optional patterns. Inconsistant state and supports mutability.

*****************************************************************Streams************************************************************

Intermediate Operations:

	maps
	filters
	sorted
	skip : The skip(n) method is an intermediate operation that discards the first n elements of a stream. It returns a stream.
	The n parameter can't be negative, and if it's higher than the size of the stream, skip() returns an empty stream.

Terminal operators:
	forEach
	Collect
	reduce: The reduce method is used to reduce the elements of a stream to a SINGLE value

*****************************************************************Reflection************************************************************
You can pass any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable, which includes all objects which implement java.io.Closeable.

*****************************************************************	class	************************************************************

Every different type of object in the running Java application will have a single Class object, these Class objects are created by the JVM. They donâ€™t have any public constructor. We can fetch that Class object using Class.forname("fullyQaulifiedName").When we write someClass.class, it references to this Class object.

Instead a Class object is constructed automatically by the Java Virtual Machine when a class loader invokes one of the defineClass methods and passes the bytes of a class file(byte code).

Class has no public constructor. 

The Class object also represents enums and intefaces along with classes in a running Java application, and have their metadata. The Class object is mostly used with the reflection capabilities of Java.

The Class object has metadata about the class. Some for the information are :
Package
Fully qualified class Name
Parent class name
Fields
Constructors
Annotations
Methods
Constant Pool
