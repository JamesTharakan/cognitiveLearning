***********************************************Patterns that i should code**********************************************************
Abstract Factory Pattern
Iterator
State:Game. Make the character to walk,talk,run,fight. Pass command and change the state. Change state A-> B, A->A 
Decorator
Bridge
************************************************************************************************************************************
update "Happens Before"

Why wait(), notify() and notifyAll() are in Object Class ?

************************************************************************************************************************************
Sometimes type casts are unavoidable and in Generic code they happen often without the programmer ever noticing. Therefore, significant effort was made to make type cast quite fast.

Telescoping constructor pattern: One constructor with only required fields and many other construtors with different combinations of optional fields. Difficult to mantain and bug prone.

JavaBeans Pattern: One constructor with only required fields and setters for all other optional patterns. Inconsistant state and supports mutability.

Streams :

maps
filters

Terminal operators:
	forEach
	Collec()
	
A Priority Queue is different from a normal queue, because instead of being a “first-in-first-out”, values come out in order by priority.

One of the devOps tool for a better project management. Maven is written in Java and is used to build projects written in C#, Scala, Ruby, etc. Based on the Project Object Model (POM).

Handles :
  Builds,Documentation,Dependencies,Reports ,SCMs,Distribution,Releases,Mailing list

Download dependencies


The build tool compiles and packages the code into an executable form.
A Maven plugin refers to the group of goals that may or may not be in the same phase


Phases of the build life cycle: :
	Compile, Test-Compile, Test, Package , Integration-Test, Verify, Install , Deploy
	

Pre-site
Site
Post-site
Site-deploy

There are two types of Maven Plugins:
Build plugins – These plugins are executed during the build and are configured in the <build/> element of pom.xml
Reporting plugins – These plugins are executed during the stage generation and are configured in the <reporting/> element of the pom.xml.


The order of inheritance in Maven is:
Settings
CLI parameters
Parent POM
Project POM


The different types of dependency scopes are:

Compile
Provided
Runtime
Test
System
Import



Primary Artifacts:
	These are like the primary dependencies which will have thier own pom and further dependencies.
Secondary Artifacts
	secondary artifact is not expected to have a remote pom and has thus never has any dependencies. With an extra tag </classifier>
		
		

To verify the downloaded artifacts Maven computes the md5 and sha1 checksum for that artifact and compares it to the values found in the checksum files located at $ARTIFACT_URL.md5, or $ARTIFACT_URL.sha1, respectively.


Snapshot :
The idea is that you can continuously push your latest changes to 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT and anyone depending on it will get the latest changes every time they build their project. Then, after a few iterations, and everyone is happy the latest state of 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT, it can be permanently released as 3.0.0, and rapid development can continue on 3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.



Check one pom.xml and see what all are defined in pom in each phase
