You run "java MyApp" from the command line. (java launcher is a executable component part of JRE kit)
The operating system runs the java executable.
The Java launcher checks the system's environment variables (JAVA_HOME, PATH) to find the JRE installation.
Once the JRE is located, the Java launcher loads the JVM binary (e.g., jvm.dll) into memory.
After loading the JVM, the launcher initializes the JVMâ€™s components like class loader, bytecode verifier, execution engine.
Then the launcher passes control to the JVM, which begins the process of loading the specified class.
Once the class is loaded and verified, the JVM will invoke the main() method of the class, which is the entry point for the application.
