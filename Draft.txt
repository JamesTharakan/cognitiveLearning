***********************
The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

Instead of seetting the next state by the current state object. Its better for each state to use a factory or some other means to set the next state.
Ex: to set the nextstate : getProcessingState()	

Stratergy and state have similar UML.

State Machine is different from state design pattern


Code an example of State Pattern:

Game. Make the character to walk,talk,run,fight. Pass command and change the state. Change state A-> B, A->A
